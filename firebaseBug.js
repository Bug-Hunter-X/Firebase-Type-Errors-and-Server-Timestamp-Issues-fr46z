The Firebase SDK may throw an error if the data in your Firestore database doesn't match the type you're expecting in your app's code. For example, if you expect a number but the database contains a string, the SDK will throw a type error.  This can be particularly problematic when dealing with complex nested objects or arrays where mismatched types might be harder to spot.  Another issue may occur when using server-side timestamps without properly configuring them, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or errors.
