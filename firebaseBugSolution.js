To address type errors, always validate data retrieved from Firestore before using it in your application.  Use TypeScript or add runtime type checks to prevent unexpected type mismatches.  For server timestamps, ensure that you've properly enabled them in your Firestore rules and that you use the `FieldValue.serverTimestamp()` method consistently for any field needing a timestamp.  Employ strong typing where possible to minimize unexpected type issues and include comprehensive error handling within your code to handle potentially problematic scenarios gracefully.
